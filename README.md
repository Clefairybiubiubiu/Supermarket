We performed several analyses to help the supermarket better understand its business operations and customer behavior:

   Analyzed average sales per transaction by day of the week to uncover differences between weekday and weekend shopping behaviors.

3. **City-Level Sales Insights**  
   Compared weekly sales and transaction counts across different cities to identify top-performing locations and regional sales dynamics.

4. **Spending Range Analysis (Transaction Count)**  
   Categorized transactions into spending ranges to understand the frequency of different spending behaviors across cities.

5. **Spending Range Analysis (Total Sales)**  
   Analyzed total revenue contribution from each spending range, highlighting the importance of high-value transactions.

   Evaluated total sales by product line to identify the top-performing categories.

   Measured total units sold by product line to understand product demand beyond just sales value.

8. **Customer Type Contribution (Members vs. Normal)**  
   Assessed total sales generated by members compared to normal customers, demonstrating the financial impact of loyalty programs.

9. **Week-over-Week Sales Growth**  
   Calculated week-over-week sales growth to identify periods of significant increases and analyze potential causes such as promotions.

10. **Relation between Ratings and Spending**

    Investigated how spending patterns vary between member and normal customers across different days of the week.
